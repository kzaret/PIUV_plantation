Variable,"Description, notes, etc.",,,,,
year,"year when measurements taken (2013, 2014, 2016, 2017, 2018 or 2019)",,,,,
year_month,year and month of sampling,,,,,
patch,"patch type:  Cushion, Transition, Burned Forest",,,,,
seedling,"seedling ID (indicates patch, transect, group, treatment; e.g., ZS01_01A = zona sphagnum (burned forest) patch, transect 1, group 1, treatment A (low position on sphagnum hummock))",,,,,
group,"group ID (indicates patch and transect, see above example)",,,,,
grouped,"binary:  1 if multiple seedlings placed together, each under different treatment condition; 0 if seedling placed singly",,,,,
id2017,in 2017 I replaced zip ties marked with seedling IDs with larger tags into which IDs had been burned (rather than written),,,,,
id2017_conf,my confidence in identifying individuals (since many of the labels written on the original zip ties were no longer visible/legible),,,,,
dist_nedge,the location of the seedling from the northern edge of the transect along which established (to help re-locate individuals/groups),,,,,
treat_det,original treatment categories recorded in field,,,,,
treat_simp,simplified for analysis,,,,,
root_sub_det,original root substrate categories,,,,,
root_sub_simp,simplified,,,,,
total height,ideally from root collar to tip,,,,,
surf_water_depth,haphazardly recorded for seedlings in pool treatment in Cushion patch,,,,,
green_height,"initially, I thought this could represent the ""new growth"" portion of a seedling stem, but there tended to be negative values in height from 13 to 16 as these portions of the stem developed bark; 2016 was the last measurement year.",,,,,
sub_surf_to_tip,the distance from the substrate surface to the tip of tallest leader (if more than one leader) of a seedling,,,,,
green_nodes1,number of green nodes on first leader,,,,,
green_nodes2,number of green nodes on second leader,,,,,
tip_nodes,"counting all of the green nodes was cumberson, so I decided to count just the newest nodes at the very tip of the tallest leader, but I didn't continue measuring this variable over time",,,,,
health_orig,description of seedling color as indicator of health as originally recorded in the field,,,,,
health,tidying / modificiation of above,,,,,
vigor,ordinal classes based on health (see below); only assigned to first year in which a seedling was observed to be dead,,,,,
vigor_all,"includes assignment of ""dead"" for all years for a dead seedling (e.g., if a seedling was first observed dead in 2016, ""dead"" was also recorded for years 2017, 2018 and 2019)",,,,,
acounted_for,"binary:  1 if present or whose status was known to be dead, 0 if missing in action (not observed to have died); gives the total count of  seedlings whose status/vigor was known for a given year (i.e., all seedlings not missing in action)",,,,,
present,"binary:  1 if present and observable in the field; 0 if missing in action or in second and subsequent years of being dead; note: ZS0701A wasn't found in 2016, but was subsequently, and was marked as present for 2016 though it wasn't actually observed/measured that year",,,,,
newly_dead,"binary: 1 for year in which first observed to be dead, 0 if alive, blank/NA for subsequent years after death-year",,,,,
dead,binary:  1 for all years in which seedling known to be dead; 0 if alive,,,,,
damaged,"binary:  1 if leader or tip damaged, bent or dead (only in year when first observed); 0 if other; NA for dead seedlings in years after observed to be newly-dead; NA for missing seedlings",,,,,
notes,notes,,,,,
notes2,"two rounds of notes were collected in 2016; RC = ""root collar"" (i.e., when I was nearly certain I was measuring height from the root collart to the tip for total height; I was doing this by feel rather than pulling up seedlings or damaging substrate)",,,,,

MISC. ADJUSTMENTS FOR ANALYSIS,,,,,,
,,,,,,
surface water depth,"sometimes recorded as <0.5 cm in 2019, changed to 0.25",,,,,
,,,,,,
Re health/vigor,,,,,,
,"I think that if I recorded a seedling as ""green"" in 2019, it likely should be ""yellow-green"" or conservatively, ""green-yellow""; and ""vibrant green"" should be ""green"" (especially w/n the Burned Forest zone)",,,,,
,"Likewise, anytime I used ""green"" as  in ""green-brown"" in 2019, it should probably be ""yellow-brown""",,,,,
,"Or, given uncertainty, I could keep my vigor ordinal classes relatively coarse and encompassing:",,,,,

keep an eye on ff seedlings in case of issues:  ,,,,,,
,"ZS04_04A and B, no C individual",,,,,
,"ZS07_01A couldn't find in 2016, but measured in 2017, 18 and 19; marked as accounted for (1) and present (1), not newly dead (0) nor dead (0) in 2016",,,,,
